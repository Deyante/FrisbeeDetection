# FrisbeeDetection
Tracking a frisbee in a video.
You need to import the whole directory, then lauch the Projet.m file on Matlab. Then click on the frisbee with your mouse to initialize its position. Then watch and enjoy :)

This code can be upragaded in so many ways, don't hesitate and try it on your own.
Be careful of the x and y, two conventions are used in the same projet due to functions not using the same convention, like f_barycentre.
